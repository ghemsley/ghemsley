## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### You've found my Github! ðŸŽ‰

I'm **Graham Hemsley**, and this is where I store a lot of the stuff I work on.

I am a proud graduate of **Flatiron School** where I studied full-stack software engineering. 

Right now I am working on a **new portfolio site** to showcase some of the projects I'm most proud of.

I'm also taking a course on **full-stack NodeJS development**.

I'm also ***looking for work!***

My main proficiencies include:
- React
- Redux
- ES6 Javascript
- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- HTML5
- CSS3
- MVC architecture
- RESTful APIs
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Photography ðŸ“¸

Fun facts about me:
- My first computer ran MS-DOS and apparently came from a junkyard
- My first memory is of booting it up to play a drawing game
- My first attempt at coding was at age 7
- My first Ruby program ran when I was 15

Please feel welcome to stop by my blog or reach out to me directly if you'd like to know more about me or my work.

Thank you for stopping by! ðŸ™‚
